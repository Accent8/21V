# Display

## Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The &lt;div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

```HTML
<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
```

## Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline &lt;span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

```HTML

<span>
<a>
<img>

```

## Display: none;

display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

The &lt;script> element uses display: none; as default.
